# AI-Driven Expense Puzzle Solver

## Project Overview

This project implements a solver for a modified version of the 8-puzzle problem, called the **Expense 8 Puzzle**. Each tileâ€™s number represents the cost of moving it, and the objective is to find the sequence of moves to reach the goal state at the minimum cost.

The solver leverages **AI search algorithms** to efficiently explore the state space and supports multiple methods, including **uninformed** and **informed search techniques**.

Supported search methods:
- **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**
- **Uniform Cost Search (UCS)**
- **Depth-First Search (DFS)**
- **Depth-Limited Search (DLS)**
- **Iterative Deepening Search (IDS)**
- **Greedy Search**
- **A\*** (default option)

## Key Features

- Implements foundational **AI search algorithms** for problem-solving.
- Utilizes heuristics to improve efficiency in Greedy and A* searches.
- Tracks search performance, including nodes expanded and fringe size.
- Modular design, supporting future algorithm extensions.

## Project Structure

The project follows a standard Maven structure:
- `src/main/java`: Contains implementation classes for algorithms and utilities.
- `src/test/java`: Includes unit tests using **JUnit**.

### Technologies Used
- **Java**: Core language for implementation.
- **Maven**: For dependency management.
- **JUnit**: For testing and validation.

## Installation and Setup

### Prerequisites
- [Java JDK 8+](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-jdk11-downloads.html)
- [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi)
- [IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/)

### Steps
1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/vinodpgowda/AI-driven-expense-8-puzzle.git
    cd AI-driven-expense-8-puzzle
    ```

2. Open in IntelliJ IDEA:
    - Open IntelliJ and navigate to `File > Open`.
    - Select the project directory.

3. Build with Maven:
    - IntelliJ will detect the `pom.xml` and set up dependencies.
    - If needed, reload Maven projects using the Maven tab.

4. Run the solver:
    - Execute the `Expense8PuzzleSolver` class with appropriate arguments.

## Usage

Run the solver from the command line:
```bash
java -jar expense-8-puzzle.jar <start-file> <goal-file> <method> <dump-flag>
```

Example:
```bash
java -jar expense-8-puzzle.jar start.txt goal.txt a* true
```
This runs the solver using the A* algorithm with search trace dumping enabled.  

  
## Search Methods

    BFS: Explores all nodes at the current depth before moving deeper.
    UCS: Explores the lowest-cost path first.
    DFS: Explores as far as possible before backtracking.
    DLS: DFS with a depth limit.
    IDS: Gradually increases depth limits.
    Greedy Search: Prioritizes nodes based on a heuristic.
    A*: Combines path cost and heuristic for optimal results.

## Input File Format

The start and goal files are plain text with a 3x3 grid:
```bash
1 2 3  
4 5 6  
7 8 0
```
Where 0 represents the empty space.
